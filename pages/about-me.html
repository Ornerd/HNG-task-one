            <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
            <p>
                In the course of this internship, I am currently running two tracks: Design and Frontend. I am concerned about balancing both tracks effectively. I worry that in order to get to the final stage of this internship, I might have to compromise on one of the tracks, and I am not sure which one to let go of.
